# DEPENDENCY_PRE-SETUP.md
## One-Time Setup for Dependency Management System

> **ü§ñ AI AGENT**: This is a ONE-TIME setup file. Execute these modifications, then delete this file.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This file prepares your existing documentation for the dependency management system by adding the necessary sections to AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, and DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md. Once complete, this file should be deleted (not archived) and the main DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_HELPER.md should be run.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Setup Checklist

Before starting, verify these files exist:
- [ ] AGENTS.md (in project root)
- [ ] INDEX.md (in project root)
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md (in project root)
- [ ] DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_HELPER.md (ready to run after this setup)

---

## üìù STEP 1: Modify AGENTS.md

### Location: After the "Active Task Registry" section
### Action: ADD the following section

```markdown
## üì¶ Package Management Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Before troubleshooting any package-related errors, warnings, or incorrect tool usage:

1. **FIRST** - Check DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md for:
   - Current installed version vs latest available
   - Known conflicts with other packages  
   - Deprecated functions or methods
   - Version-specific capabilities and limitations
   - Recent update history that might explain new behavior

2. **When encountering package errors**:
   - Verify error against documented warnings in catalogue
   - Check if package is locked at specific version (and why)
   - Review breaking changes if recently updated
   - Consider rollback procedures if critical

3. **Before suggesting package updates**:
   - Consult the version lock list
   - Review documented conflicts
   - Check the last update date (monthly cycle)
   - Verify no breaking changes affect current code

**Monthly Maintenance**: Check if today is within 5 days of the monthly update date. If yes, remind user that package updates are due.
```

### Verification
- [ ] Section added after "Active Task Registry"
- [ ] No duplicate sections created
- [ ] Formatting preserved

---

## üìù STEP 2: Modify INDEX.md

### Part A - Documentation Section
### Location: In the "Documentation" table (usually in lower half of file)
### Action: ADD this row to the table

```markdown
| DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md | Package Version Tracking | ‚è≥ Pending | All Agents | [Today's Date] |
```

**Note**: Status is "‚è≥ Pending" because the catalogue doesn't exist yet. It will be created by DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_HELPER.md.

### Part B - Known Issues Section  
### Location: In "Known Issues & Technical Debt" section
### Action: ADD this subsection

```markdown
### Package Version Management
**Reference**: DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md for complete package information

**Version Locks** (Packages held at specific versions):
- See catalogue for full list and reasons
- Next monthly update: [Pending - will be set on first run]

**Known Package Issues**:
- Check catalogue before troubleshooting
- Document new issues in catalogue
- Update after each monthly maintenance
```

### Verification
- [ ] Documentation table row added
- [ ] Known Issues subsection added
- [ ] No formatting broken

## üìù STEP 3: Modify DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md

### Part A - Work Area Code Matrix
### Location: In the "Work Area Code Matrix" table (near top of file)
### Action: ADD these rows to the existing table

```markdown
| DEPS | Dependencies | Package updates, version management | [Today's Date] | [Today's Date] | 0 |
| MAINT | Maintenance | Monthly updates, security patches | [Today's Date] | [Today's Date] | 0 |
```

**Note**: Entry count starts at 0 since no entries exist yet.

### Part B - Quick Reference Index
### Location: In the "Quick Reference Index" section
### Action: ADD these lines alphabetically

```markdown
DEPS:  [Will be populated after first use]
MAINT: [Will be populated after first use]
```

### Part C - Recurring Tasks Registry
### Location: In "Recurring Tasks Registry" section (create if doesn't exist)
### Action: ADD this task template

```markdown
### DEPS - Monthly Package Updates
**Schedule**: Day [TBD] of each month (will be set on first run)
**Reference**: DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md for procedures
1. Check DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md for next update date
2. Follow "Monthly Update Checklist" in catalogue
