## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 🆕 For NEW Projects (Starting Fresh)

Download and add these files to your project root:
1. `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Creates AGENTS.md with task management
2. `PROJECT_INDEX_STARTER.md` - Creates INDEX.md for file tracking
3. `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` - Creates DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for history
4. `DEPENDENCY_PRE-SETUP.md` - Prepares for dependency management
5. `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_HELPER.md` - Creates DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md

**Activation Sequence**:
```bash
1. "Please activate AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md to create AGENTS.md"
2. "Please activate PROJECT_INDEX_STARTER.md to create INDEX.md"
3. "Please activate DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md to create the development log"
4. "Please run DEPENDENCY_PRE-SETUP.md to prepare for dependency management"
5. "Please execute DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_HELPER.md to create the dependency catalogue"
```

### 🔄 For EXISTING Projects (Retrofitting)

Download ALL files, then:
1. **First**: Run `PROJECT_RETROFIT_PROMPT.md` to analyze your codebase
2. **Then**: Follow the activation sequence above with pre-filled data

**Retrofit Command**:
```bash
"Please execute PROJECT_RETROFIT_PROMPT.md to analyze and prepare this existing project for AI-assisted development"
```

## 🤖 AI Agent Best Practices

### Working with Your Upgraded Agent (AGENTS.md)

#### 1. **Task Management**
When requesting new work, your agent will:
```markdown
🤖 "I see Task A is 70% complete. Should I:
1. ✅ Finish Task A first (recommended)
2. ⏳ Queue your new request
3. 🔄 Switch now (not recommended)"
```

**Best Practice**: Trust the agent's recommendation unless urgent.

#### 2. **Update Tracking**
After EVERY work session:
```bash
"Please add the previous developments to INDEX.md, following the best practices set forth in the indexing instructions"

"Please create a development log entry for the work just completed, using the codes from the matrix and updating the line number index"
```

#### 3. **Finding Related Work**
Use codes to quickly locate related changes:
```bash
# In DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md, if you see:
JSON: 17, 45, 87, 144, 981, 1084

# Jump to line 87 to see JSON-related work
# Check if line 87 appears in other codes (AUTH, API, etc.)
```

#### 4. **Monthly Maintenance**
On the designated day each month:
```bash
"Please check if monthly dependency updates are due and run the update process if needed"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Complex Issues

### The SITUATIONAL-REPORT.md Workflow

When facing complex bugs that resist initial debugging:

#### Step 1: xAI Creates Initial Analysis
```bash
"Please analyze this issue [describe issue] and create a comprehensive SITUATIONAL-REPORT.md including:
- All affected files
- Complete dependency chain
- Error traces and logs
- Potential root causes
- Related code sections
- Environmental factors"
```

#### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
- Commit SITUATIONAL-REPORT.md to repository
- Ensure all relevant code is pushed

#### Step 3: Claude Opus 4.1 Reviews
In Claude.ai (not Kiro):
```bash
"Please review this repository [GitHub URL] and the SITUATIONAL-REPORT.md to understand the issue and create a detailed resolution specification"
```

#### Step 4: Kiro Implements Fix
With Claude Sonnet 4 in Kiro:
```bash
"Using this specification [paste spec from Opus], please implement the fix for the issue described"
```

#### Step 5: Verify & Document
```bash
"Please verify the fix resolves the issue and update:
- INDEX.md with the changes
- DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with the resolution
- DEPENDENCY_CATALOGUE.md if packages were involved"
```
