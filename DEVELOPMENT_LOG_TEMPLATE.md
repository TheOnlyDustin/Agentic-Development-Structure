# DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - Session History
## Universal AI Agent Development Log

> **AI AGENT**: Add a new entry for EVERY work session. Never delete old entries. Read recent entries before starting work.

## 📖 How to Use This Log

### Starting a Session
1. **Read the last 2-3 entries** to understand current state
2. **Create a new entry** using the template below
3. **Note your session goal** before starting work
4. **Update continuously** as you work, not just at the end

### During Development
- Log decisions AS YOU MAKE THEM
- Document workarounds IMMEDIATELY
- Note any unexpected discoveries
- Track time spent on tasks

### Ending a Session
- Complete ALL sections of your entry
- Verify "Next Session Should" is specific
- Ensure another agent could continue your work
- Run verification commands and log results

### 📁 Files Modified/Created
```
/package.json - Created - Project dependencies
/tsconfig.json - Created - TypeScript configuration
/src/index.ts - Created - Entry point
/.env.template - Created - Environment template
```

### 🔧 Decisions & Rationale

**Decision**: Use Next.js App Router instead of Pages Router
**Options Considered**: Pages Router (simpler), App Router (newer)
**Reasoning**: App Router is the recommended approach for new projects
**Impact**: All routes will be in /app directory, not /pages

### 🐛 Issues & Solutions

**Issue #1**: Port 3000 already in use
- **Error Message**: `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`
- **Cause**: Another service running on port 3000
- **Solution**: Changed to port 3001 in package.json
- **TODO**: Document port change in README

### 🧪 Testing & Verification
```bash
npm run dev - ✅ Server starts on port 3001
npm run build - ✅ Builds successfully
npm test - ⚠️ No tests yet
```

### 📌 Placeholders & Mocks
- **Mock/Placeholder**: Hardcoded API URL
  - **Location**: `/src/config/api.ts:5`
  - **Purpose**: Development testing
  - **Replace with**: Environment variable
  - **Priority**: High

### 🔄 Dependencies & Packages
**Added**: 
- `next@14.0.0` - Framework
- `typescript@5.0.0` - Type safety
- `@types/react@18.0.0` - React types

### 💡 Discoveries & Learnings
- **Discovery**: Next.js 14 has built-in TypeScript support
  **Impact**: No need for separate TS configuration
  **Action**: Removed redundant TS setup steps

### ⚠️ Warnings for Next Session

**IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE STARTING**:
1. Server runs on port 3001, NOT 3000
2. Don't change the App Router structure
3. Environment variables not set up yet

### 🎯 Next Session Should

**Priority #1**: Set up environment variables
- Start with: Create .env.local from .env.template
- Goal: Configure all required environment variables
- Context: Needed before database connection

**Priority #2**: Initialize database connection
**Priority #3**: Create basic data models

**Blocked By**: Need database credentials
