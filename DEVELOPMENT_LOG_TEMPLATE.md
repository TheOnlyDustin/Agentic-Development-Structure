# DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
## Self-Deploying Development Log System with Smart Indexing

---

# 🚀 PART 1: DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

> **AI AGENT**: Execute these steps to deploy the development logging system.

## Step 1: Create DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
Copy the template from Part 2 below into a new file called `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` in the project root.

## Step 2: Generate Work Area Codes
Based on your INDEX.md analysis, identify the primary work areas and assign 4-5 character codes:

### Standard Code Matrix (Extend based on project)
```
# Core Infrastructure
SETUP - Initial setup, configuration, environment
NODE  - Node.js runtime issues, package management
BUILD - Build process, bundling, compilation
DEPS  - Dependencies, package updates
ENV   - Environment variables, configuration

# Data & Storage
JSON  - JSON structure, parsing, validation
DATA  - Database operations, queries
CACHE - Caching layer, Redis, memory cache
FILE  - File system operations
MIGR  - Database migrations

# Authentication & Security
AUTH  - Authentication logic
OAUTH - OAuth implementation (Google, GitHub, etc.)
SESS  - Session management
SECUR - Security fixes, vulnerabilities
CORS  - CORS configuration

# API & Communication
API   - API endpoints, REST operations
GRAPH - GraphQL schemas, resolvers
SOCK  - WebSocket, real-time communication
HOOK  - Webhooks, external integrations

# Frontend
UI    - User interface components
STYLE - CSS, styling, themes
REACT - React/Vue/Angular specific
STATE - State management (Redux, MobX)
ROUTE - Routing, navigation

# Quality & Testing
TEST  - Test creation, test fixes
LINT  - Linting, code style
PERF  - Performance optimization
DEBUG - Debugging sessions
ERROR - Error handling

# DevOps
DOCK  - Docker, containerization
CI    - CI/CD pipeline
DEPLOY- Deployment issues
MONITOR- Monitoring, logging

# Documentation
DOCS  - Documentation updates
INDEX - INDEX.md updates
README- README updates
```

Add project-specific codes as discovered in the codebase.

## Step 3: Backfill from Historical Data

### 3.1 Extract Git History
```bash
# Get commit history with details
git log --pretty=format:"%h|%ad|%s|%an" --date=short > git_history.tmp

# Get file change statistics
git log --stat --pretty=format:"%h|%ad|%s" --date=short > git_changes.tmp

# Identify major commits (more than 10 files changed)
git log --stat --pretty=format:"%h|%ad|%s" --date=short | grep -B2 "files changed" | grep -E "[1-9][0-9]+ files" -B2
```

### 3.2 Analyze Existing Documentation
Review these sources for historical context:
- Commit messages for work descriptions
- PR descriptions if available
- TODO/FIXME comments with dates
- Changelog or release notes
- Any existing dev logs or notes
- Steering documents showing decisions

### 3.3 Create Retroactive Entries
For each significant commit or work session found:
1. Identify the work area codes that apply
2. Create a log entry in the standard format
3. Note the actual or estimated date
4. Add line number to the index

## Step 4: Initialize the Index System
At the top of DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md, populate the Quick Reference Index with line numbers for each code.

## Step 5: Move Template to DOCS
```bash
# Create DOCS folder if needed
mkdir -p DOCS

# Move this template file
mv DEVELOPMENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md DOCS/

# Update any references in INDEX.md
```

## Step 6: Add User Prompt to INDEX.md
Add this reminder in the INDEX.md header:
```markdown
<!-- 
📝 LOGGING REMINDER:
After each development task, update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md using:
"Please create a development log entry for the work just completed, using the codes from the matrix and updating the line number index"
-->
```

## Step 7: Verification
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md exists in root
- [ ] Quick Reference Index is populated
- [ ] Work Area Code Matrix includes all relevant areas
- [ ] Historical entries are backfilled (if git history exists)
- [ ] Template moved to DOCS/
- [ ] INDEX.md references are updated
- [ ] User prompt is documented

## 🤖 AI Agent Instructions

### When Creating New Entries:
1. **Assign appropriate codes** from the matrix (2-4 codes per entry typically)
2. **Note the line number** where your entry starts
3. **Update the Quick Reference Index** with the new line number
4. **Update intersection list** if entry has multiple codes
5. **Keep entries concise** - link to INDEX.md for details
6. **Focus on WHAT changed and WHY**, not extensive HOW

### When Reading History:
1. **Use the Quick Reference Index** to find related work
2. **Check intersections** for complex issues
3. **Review patterns** in Statistics section
4. **Check Critical Learnings** before starting work

### Maintenance Tasks:
- Every 50 entries: Archive older entries to `/DOCS/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_ARCHIVE_[date].md`
- Weekly: Update Statistics & Patterns section
- Monthly: Review and consolidate Critical Learnings
